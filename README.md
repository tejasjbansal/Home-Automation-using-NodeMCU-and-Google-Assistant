# Home-Automation-using-NodeMCU-and-Google-Assistant

In this project, we will be connecting and controlling our ESP8266 Wi-Fi based module from our mobile phoneâ€™s Google Assistant Application. The charisma here is that your google assistant will take voice commands in Hindi and perform actions on ESP8266 . It will then perform actions based on our voice commands. This project is amazing and helpful for those who want to make a Voice operated IoT Home Automation for their parents who are not able to speak English. To make everything work, we will also require Adafruit IO and IFTTT. We will add up everything to work.
